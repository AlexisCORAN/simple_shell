.SH DESCRIPTION
The hsh shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.
.B Overview
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or 
the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system.
.B Interactive mode
The commands are run with user-interaction from keyboard. 
E.g. the shell can prompt the user to enter input.
.B Non-interactive mode
The shell is probably run from an automated process so it can't assume if can request input or that someone will see the output.
E.g Maybe it is best to write output to a log-file.
